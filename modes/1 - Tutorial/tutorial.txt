SUBJECT: HOW TO DO YOUR JOB

You will get emails forwarded to you on this screen, with the contents being the message you must decrypt.
A key will also be passed along to you. This key is only letters, with each letter being a different encryption method and key if there is one. Example: `A` could be a Caesar cipher with a key of 5, and `B` could be an Atbash cipher. If the key was stated as `BA`, then you would first do the Atbash cipher, then the Caesar with that key.

(The letters will be the same per save, but will change even on the same mode.)

After writing your code, and testing the output, email the result directly to me.
